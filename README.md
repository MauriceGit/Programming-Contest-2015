# Programming-Contest-2015
Implementation of an artificial intelligence for the game SameGame.
I used mainly a monte-carlo tree search approach with some pruning and random branch selection.
The tree search is optimized for different input field sizes and parallelized for four cores.

It was created in the context of a programming contest of the FH-Wedel (Wedel, Germany).

This (my) implementation achieved the 3. place overall. The total number of participants was 15.
